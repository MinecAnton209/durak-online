# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values for your environment.
# DO NOT COMMIT your actual secrets in the .env file.
# ===============================================================

# --- Server & Environment ---

# The port the server will run on.
# Default: 3000
PORT=3000

# The environment the application is running in.
# This is crucial for security settings (e.g., cookies, CORS).
# Possible values: 'development' (for local setup), 'production' (for Render.com).
NODE_ENV=development


# --- Database Configuration ---

# The database client to use.
# Possible values: 'sqlite', 'postgres'.
# 'sqlite' is recommended for local development.
DB_CLIENT=sqlite

# The connection string for your PostgreSQL database.
# Only required if DB_CLIENT is set to 'postgres'.
# Example: postgres://user:password@host:port/database
DATABASE_URL=


# --- Session & Security ---

# This secret is used to sign JWT tokens for authentication.
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - MUST be set in production (server will fail to start without it)
# - MUST be at least 32 characters long
# - MUST be random and unpredictable
# - NEVER commit this to version control
# - NEVER share this value
# Generate one with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
JWT_SECRET=

# A long, random string used to sign SESSION_SECRET cookie (fallback for JWT if JWT_SECRET not set).
# For production, use a strong, randomly generated string.
SESSION_SECRET="generate_a_long_random_string_here_for_production"

# The domain for the session cookie.
# For production, if the admin panel and the game are on different subdomains,
# set this to your main domain with a leading dot.
# Example: .crushtalm.pp.ua
# Leave blank for local development (localhost).
COOKIE_DOMAIN=

# The URL of your React admin panel for CORS configuration.
# This allows the admin panel to make API requests to this server.
# For local development: http://localhost:5173
# For production: https://admin.yourdomain.com
ADMIN_CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173


# --- Game Logic ---

# The minimum duration of a game in seconds.
# Games that finish faster than this are marked as suspicious.
MIN_GAME_DURATION_SECONDS=15


# --- Web Push Notifications (VAPID Keys) ---
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# These keys are required for sending push notifications.
# Generate them once for your project by running `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`.
# KEEP YOUR PRIVATE KEY SECRET.

# The subject for VAPID, typically a mailto or a website link.
# This is used by push services to identify the sender.
# Example: mailto:your-email@example.com
VAPID_SUBJECT=

# Your VAPID public key. This key will be sent to the browser.
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=

# Your VAPID private key. This key must be kept secret on the server.
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=
